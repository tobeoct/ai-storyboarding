  **Few-Shot Example:**

  Input Storyboard:
  Panel 1: PROMPT: Wide shot of empty office building at night
  AUDIO: It was another late night at the office...

  Panel 2: PROMPT: Close-up of coffee cup on desk, steam rising
  AUDIO: The coffee had gone cold hours ago

  Panel 3: PROMPT: Medium shot of person typing at computer, blue screen light
  AUDIO: But the deadline wasn't going to meet itself

  Expected Analysis:

  ## Narrative Structure
  **Strengths:** Clear establishment of time, place, and mood. The progression from wide to close-up to medium creates good visual flow.
  **Improvements:** Consider adding a character-revealing moment or conflict setup in the opening sequence.

  ## Visual Storytelling
  **Strengths:** Good use of environmental details (cold coffee) to show time passage. Screen light effectively conveys late-night work atmosphere.
  **Improvements:** Shot variety could be enhanced with different angles. Consider a high angle or low angle to add visual interest.

  ## Pacing & Rhythm
  **Strengths:** Steady build-up with clear time progression indicated through visual cues.
  **Improvements:** Audio pacing feels slightly slow - consider tightening the narration for better engagement.

  ## Technical Considerations
  **Continuity:** Good - coffee cup and lighting remain consistent with nighttime setting.
  **Production Notes:** Consider practical lighting setup for the computer screen glow effect.
